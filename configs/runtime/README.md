# Runtime Configuration Files

This directory is to contain configuration files for the components of the
streamlined onboarding demo. These include:

* Build configuration for `hostapd`
* Runtime configuration for `hostapd`
* Build configuration for `wpa_supplicant`
* Runtime configuration for `wpa_supplicant`
* Runtime configuration for OCF devices
  * Specifies the HostAP control interface that the devices should interact with

These configuration files **should not** be checked into Git and all files in
this directory except this README are correspondingly ignored.
