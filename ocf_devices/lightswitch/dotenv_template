# Development environment variables |

# Copy this example file to ./.env - This file is read using python-dotenv,
# which will automatically load the environment variables specified here. Known
# environment variables are listed below with brief descriptions.

#--------------------#
# Required Variables |
#--------------------#
# These variables must be set for the streamlined onboarding switch to properly
# operate and interact with the Wi-Fi stack.

# Which interface should be used for Easy Connect operations.
# SO_IFACE specifies the name of the Wi-Fi interface that the device will use
# for streamliend onboarding. WPA_CTRL_IFACE specifies the full path to the
# wpa_supplicant control socket (typically located at
# /var/run/wpa_supplicant/<iface_name>)
SO_IFACE=wlan0
WPA_CTRL_IFACE=/var/run/wpa_supplicant/wlan0

# Path to credential directory for OCF Devices. Switch applications default to
# ./lightswitch_creds
# This directory should exist should provide write access.
SO_LIGHTSWITCH_CREDS=/var/local/streamlined_onboarding/lightswitch_creds

#--------------------------------#
# Optional Development Variables |
#--------------------------------#
# These variables do not need to be set for the application to run. However,
# they are useful for development environments.

# gpiozero can be configured to operate on systems that do not have a GPIO
# interface. These variables enable this; see gpiozero documentation for further
# information.
# GPIOZERO_PIN_FACTORY=mock
# GPIOZERO_MOCK_PIN_CLASS=mockpwmpin

# Convenient to set the display if you're running over SSH, instead of directly
# on the system running the application.
# DISPLAY=':0'

# Specify a development environment to ensure that the reboot button simply
# exits the application. The application will also not start in fullscreen in
# the development mode.
# ENV=dev

# QT Debugging info may be useful when tracking down some harder to find issues.
# QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1

# Whether or not to persist credentials across runs (any value indicates that
# credentials should persist)
# SO_PERSIST_CREDS=1
